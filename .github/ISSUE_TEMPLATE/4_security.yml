        **⚠️ SECURITY VULNERABILITY NOTICE ⚠️**

        If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**.

        Use GitHub's private security advisory feature: [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/nicotsx/zerobyte/security/advisories/new)

        This helps us address security issues responsibly before they can be exploited.
