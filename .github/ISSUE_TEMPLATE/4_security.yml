        **⚠️ SECURITY VULNERABILITY NOTICE ⚠️**

        If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**.

        Please report security vulnerabilities privately through one of these methods:

        - Use GitHub's private security advisory feature: [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/nicotsx/zerobyte/security/advisories/new)
        - Contact the maintainers directly via email if listed in the repository

        This helps us address security issues responsibly before they can be exploited.

        **Thank you for helping keep Zerobyte secure! 🔒**
